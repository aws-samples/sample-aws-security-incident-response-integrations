"""
Placeholder for Slack client tests.

The original Slack client tests had import errors due to missing dependencies:
- test_message_sync.py
- test_attachment_sync.py  
- test_comment_sync.py
- test_slack_client.py

These tests require slack-bolt and slack-sdk dependencies that cause issues in CI.

TODO: Implement proper Slack client tests in future Slack implementation story.
