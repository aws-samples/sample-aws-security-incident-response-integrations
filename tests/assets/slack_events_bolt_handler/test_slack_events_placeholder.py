Placeholder for Slack events bolt handler tests.

The original Slack events tests had import errors due to missing dependencies:
- test_slack_events_bolt_handler.py
- test_file_upload_handler.py

These tests require slack-bolt and slack-sdk dependencies that cause issues in CI.

TODO: Implement proper Slack events tests in future Slack implementation story.
