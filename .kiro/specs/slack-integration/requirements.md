# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Slack integration for AWS Security Incident Response extends the existing sample integrations architecture to provide bidirectional connectivity between AWS Security Incident Response and Slack. This integration enables real-time notifications, interactive incident management, and seamless collaboration within Slack channels. The solution follows the same architectural patterns as existing JIRA and ServiceNow integrations, utilizing EventBridge, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB for state management. Additionally, the integration provides users with the ability to access and trace CloudWatch and CloudTrail logs associated with security incidents directly from Slack, offering comprehensive visibility into incident-related activities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to receive real-time notifications in Slack when new AWS Security Incident Response cases are created, so that I can immediately begin incident response activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new AWS SIR case is created THEN the system SHALL create a new channel for this case, and add the watchers in the case to the slack channel. The channel should be named as `aws-security-incident-response-case-<caseId>`
2. WHEN the channel is created THEN the system SHALL add a system comment to the AWS SIR case with tag [Slack Update] containing the Slack channel name
3. WHEN the channel is created, a notification is sent by the system, and it SHALL include case ID, severity, title, description, and creation timestamp
4. WHEN the notification is displayed THEN it SHALL include information about available slash commands (/security-ir status, /security-ir update-status, /security-ir update-description, /security-ir update-title, /security-ir close, /security-ir summarize)
5. WHEN system comments are tagged with [Slack Update] THEN they SHALL NOT be reflected back to the Slack channel to avoid notification loops
6. IF the Slack API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want to update AWS SIR case status and add comments directly from Slack using slash commands, so that I can manage incidents without switching between tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/security-ir status` THEN the system SHALL return the current case status and details
2. WHEN a user types `/security-ir update-status <new-status>` THEN the system SHALL update the AWS SIR case status and reflect changes in both systems
3. WHEN a user types `/security-ir update-description <new-description>` THEN the system SHALL update the AWS SIR case description and reflect changes in both systems
4. WHEN a user types `/security-ir update-title <new-title>` THEN the system SHALL update the AWS SIR case title and reflect changes in both systems
5. WHEN a user types `/security-ir close` THEN the system SHALL close the AWS SIR case and update the channel accordingly
6. WHEN a user types `/security-ir summarize` THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the case including key events and current status
5. WHEN a user posts any comment in the Slack channel (excluding system notifications) THEN the system SHALL sync the comment to AWS SIR as a case comment with proper attribution
6. WHEN slash commands are used THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions before applying changes
7. IF a command fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback to the user in Slack

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an incident responder, I want to see AWS SIR case updates reflected in Slack automatically, so that all team members stay informed of incident progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AWS SIR case is updated externally THEN the system SHALL post an update message to the associated Slack channel
2. WHEN case status changes THEN the system SHALL post a status update message in the channel
3. WHEN new comments are added to AWS SIR THEN the system SHALL post them as messages in the Slack channel
4. WHEN case watchers are added or removed THEN the system SHALL add or remove users from the Slack channel accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security team lead, I want robust error handling for all Slack operations, so that failures are properly managed and reported back to the AWS Security Incident Response system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Slack operation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff (initial delay 1s, max delay 60s, max 5 retries)
2. WHEN Slack channel creation fails THEN the system SHALL retry and if all retries fail, add a system comment to the AWS SIR case with tag [Slack Update]
3. WHEN Slack channel updates fail THEN the system SHALL retry and if all retries fail, add a system comment to the AWS SIR case with tag [Slack Update]
4. WHEN Slack user addition/removal fails THEN the system SHALL retry and if all retries fail, add a system comment to the AWS SIR case with tag [Slack Update]
5. WHEN system comments are added due to Slack failures THEN they SHALL include the specific error details and timestamp

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Slack integration to maintain bidirectional synchronization state, so that data consistency is preserved between AWS SIR and Slack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN incidents are synchronized THEN the system SHALL store mapping data in DynamoDB using PK/SK pattern where PK is `Case#<case-id>` and SK is `latest`
2. WHEN mapping records are created THEN the system SHALL include the attribute `slackChannelId` to store the Slack channel ID for the respective SIR case
3. WHEN mapping records are created THEN the system SHALL include attributes `slackChannelCaseDescription`, `slackChannelCaseTitle`, `slackChannelCaseComments`, and `slackChannelUpdateTimestamp`
4. WHEN records are entered or updated in DynamoDB THEN the system SHALL set `slackChannelUpdateTimestamp` to the current timestamp
5. WHEN updating or adding new comments THEN the system SHALL check if the comment already exists on the respective case before adding to prevent duplicates
6. WHEN synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL track last update timestamps for conflict resolution using the `slackChannelUpdateTimestamp` attribute
7. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL apply last-writer-wins strategy based on timestamps and log conflicts
8. WHEN sync failures occur THEN the system SHALL use dead-letter queues for retry processing
9. IF mapping data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for data recovery

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security operations manager, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of the Slack integration, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration events occur THEN the system SHALL log all activities to CloudWatch with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request/response metadata without sensitive data
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context for troubleshooting
4. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track response times, success rates, and throughput
5. IF sensitive data is encountered THEN the system SHALL never log tokens, passwords, or PII

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want all my regular messages in the incident Slack channel to be automatically logged as case comments in AWS SIR, so that all communication is preserved in the official incident record.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user posts a message in the incident Slack channel THEN the system SHALL automatically sync it to AWS SIR as a case comment
2. WHEN messages are synced THEN the system SHALL exclude system-generated notifications and bot messages
3. WHEN comments are created in AWS SIR THEN the system SHALL include the Slack user's name and timestamp
4. WHEN message sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log failures
5. IF a message contains sensitive information THEN the system SHALL sync it but apply appropriate security handling

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security operations manager, I want to track when new users are added to incident Slack channels, so that I have visibility into who has access to sensitive incident information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user is added to an incident Slack channel THEN the system SHALL add a comment to the corresponding AWS SIR case with tag [Slack Update]
2. WHEN the system comment is created THEN it SHALL specify the name/username of the user who was added
3. WHEN the system comment is created THEN it SHALL include the timestamp of when the user was added
4. WHEN comments are tagged with [Slack Update] THEN they SHALL NOT be reflected back to the Slack channel to avoid notification loops
5. IF user addition tracking fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue normal operations

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want attachments uploaded to incident Slack channels to be synchronized with AWS Security Incident Response, so that all evidence and documentation is preserved in the official incident record.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an attachment to an incident Slack channel THEN the system SHALL download and sync the attachment to the corresponding AWS SIR case
2. WHEN an attachment is uploaded with an associated comment THEN the system SHALL sync both the attachment and comment together to AWS SIR
3. WHEN an attachment is uploaded without a comment THEN the system SHALL sync the attachment with a system-generated description including filename and upload timestamp
4. WHEN an attachment is added to an AWS SIR case externally THEN the system SHALL upload the attachment to the corresponding Slack channel
5. WHEN attachments are synced from AWS SIR to Slack THEN the system SHALL include a message indicating the attachment source and any associated comments
6. WHEN attachments are synced in either direction THEN the system SHALL preserve original filename, file type, and metadata where possible
7. WHEN attachment sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and add a system comment with tag [Slack Update] describing the failure
8. IF attachment size exceeds platform limits THEN the system SHALL add appropriate notifications indicating the attachment could not be synced due to size constraints
