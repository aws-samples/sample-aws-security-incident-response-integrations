## Architecture

![JIRA Integration for AWS Security Incident Response Architecture](images/AWS-Security-Incident-Response-JIRA-architecture.png)

### Core AWS Services

The solution leverages the following AWS services:

- **Amazon EventBridge**: Central event bus for routing events between systems
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for processing events and API calls
- **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)**: Messaging service for receiving events from external systems
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Webhook endpoint for receiving events from ServiceNow
- **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)**: Dead-letter queue for handling failed events
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing mapping information between systems
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**: Secure storage for credentials and configuration
- **AWS Security Incident Response (SIR)**: Core security incident response service

### JIRA Integration Flow

There are two bidirectional flows in the integration between Jira and AWS Security Incident Response (SIR).

#### Flow 1: AWS Security Incident Response to Jira

1. The **Security IR Poller Lambda** periodically polls for incidents generated by SIR
2. It stores the incident details in DynamoDB and publishes Create, Update, or Delete events to EventBridge
3. The **Jira Client Lambda** subscribes to these EventBridge events
4. It gets or compares the incident details, updates the Jira issue ID, and performs the appropriate action in Jira (Create, Update, or Delete Jira issues)

#### Flow 2: Jira to AWS Security Incident Response

1. Jira publishes Create, Update, or Delete events of issues to the **Jira SNS Topic** via Jira Automation
2. The **Jira Notification Handler Lambda** subscribes to the SNS Topic and processes these events
3. It publishes the events to EventBridge
4. The **Security IR Client Lambda** subscribes to the Jira issue events and performs the appropriate operation (Create, Update, or Delete) on SIR

For detailed information about the Jira integration, including setup instructions, configuration details, and troubleshooting tips, see the [Jira Integration Documentation](JIRA.md).

### ServiceNow Integration Flow

The ServiceNow integration follows a similar pattern to the Jira integration, but with some key differences in implementation:

#### Flow 1: ServiceNow to AWS Security Incident Response

1. ServiceNow incidents trigger a **Business Rule** when created, updated, or closed
2. The Business Rule sends the incident data to an **API Gateway webhook endpoint**
3. The **ServiceNow Notifications Handler Lambda** processes the webhook request and publishes events to EventBridge
4. The **Security IR Client Lambda** subscribes to these events and performs the appropriate operations in AWS Security Incident Response

#### Flow 2: AWS Security Incident Response to ServiceNow

1. The **Security IR Poller Lambda** polls for incidents from AWS Security Incident Response
2. Events are published to EventBridge
3. The **ServiceNow Client Lambda** processes these events
4. The ServiceNow Client Lambda updates or creates incidents in ServiceNow via the ServiceNow API

#### Automatic ServiceNow Setup

The integration includes a **ServiceNow Resource Setup Lambda** that automatically configures the necessary components in ServiceNow during deployment:
- Business Rules for incident events
- Outbound REST Messages for API communication
- Script Includes for data formatting

For detailed information about the ServiceNow integration, including setup instructions, configuration details, and troubleshooting tips, see the [ServiceNow Integration Documentation](SERVICE_NOW.md).

#### Error Handling

To avoid losing events after they fail to be delivered to EventBridge, we have configured a dead-letter queue (DLQ) and send all failed events to it for processing later. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for more information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** with permissions to create the required resources
- **AWS CDK** v2.x installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- **Python 3.9+** installed

### Quick Start

```bash
# For Jira integration
deploy-integrations-solution jira \
  --email <your-jira-email> \
  --url <your-jira-url> \
  --token <your-jira-api-token>

# For ServiceNow integration
deploy-integrations-solution service-now \
  --instance <your-servicenow-instance-id> \
  --username <your-servicenow-username> \
  --password <your-servicenow-password>
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Jira Integration Documentation](JIRA.md) or [ServiceNow Integration Documentation](SERVICE_NOW.md).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install development dependencies (optional):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Deployment

For deployment of an integration pattern, install and use the `deploy-integrations-solution` supplementary python app
in the command-line using the following steps:

1. Add the `deploy-integrations-solution.py` script to the `bin` path:
   ```
   sudo cp deploy-integrations-solution.py /usr/local/bin/deploy-integrations-solution\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/deploy-integrations-solution\n
   ```
2. Verify if the `deploy-integrations-solution` works in the command-line by running:
   ```
   deploy-integrations-solution --help
   ```
   You should see the following output:
   ```
   usage: deploy-integrations-solution [-h] [--log-level {info,debug,error}] {jira,service-now} ...

   Deploy AWS Security Incident Response Sample Integrations

   positional arguments:
   {jira,service-now}    Integration type
      jira                Deploy Jira integration
      service-now         Deploy ServiceNow integration

   options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   --log-level {info,debug,error}
                           Log level for Lambda functions
   ```
3. Use the `jira` argument to deploy the JIRA integration:
   `deploy-integrations-solution jira -h`
   You should see the following output:
   ```
   usage: deploy-integrations-solution jira [-h] --email EMAIL --url URL --token TOKEN

   options:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      --email EMAIL  Jira email
      --url URL      Jira URL
      --token TOKEN  Jira API token
   ```
   Provide the respective parameters for each of the above arguments to perform a deploy:
   `deploy-integrations-solution jira --email <email> --url <url> --token <token>`
4. Use the `service-now` argument to deploy the ServiceNow integration:
   `deploy-integrations-solution service-now -h`
   You should see the following output:
   ```
   usage: deploy-integrations-solution service-now [-h] --instance INSTANCE --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD

   options:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit
      --instance INSTANCE  ServiceNow instance ID
      --username USERNAME  ServiceNow username
      --password PASSWORD  ServiceNow password
   ```
   Provide the respective parameters for each of the above arguments to perform a deploy:
   `deploy-integrations-solution service-now --instance <instance> --username <username> --password <password>`
5. Use the `--log-level` to set the value as `info`, `debug`, `error`. The default log-level is set to `error`
6. Alternatively, if you are not able to add the `deploy-integrations-solution.py` script to the `bin` path, you can
   use the script directly by replacing `deploy-integrations-solution` in the above examples with
   `./deploy-integrations-solution.py` command.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Failed Event Delivery

**What happens if updates from AWS Security Incident Response or Jira/ServiceNow fail?**

The integration includes robust error handling mechanisms:

1. **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Events that fail to be delivered to EventBridge are sent to a DLQ
2. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Alarms trigger when messages appear in the DLQ
3. **CloudWatch Dashboard**: Provides visibility into the integration's health

![AWS Security Incident Response CloudWatch Dashboard](images/cloud-watch.png)

**Where is the DLQ?**

The DLQ is a standard Amazon SQS queue that EventBridge uses to store events that couldn't be delivered to a target. Look for an SQS queue with a name similar to `AwsSecurityIncidentResponseSample-SecurityIncidentEventBusLoggerdead-*` and check for messages.

#### Processing Failed Events

To process failed events in the DLQ:

1. Navigate to the SQS console and find the DLQ
2. Select the messages and choose "View/Delete Messages"
3. Examine the message content to understand the failure
4. Manually process the events or use the AWS SDK to programmatically process them
