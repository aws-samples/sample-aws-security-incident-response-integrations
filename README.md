# AWS Security Incident Response Sample Integrations

This project provides sample integrations for AWS Security Incident Response, enabling customers to seamlessly integrate the service with their existing applications for incident response, stakeholder notifications, and case management.

## Overview

AWS Security Incident Response helps customers respond when it matters the most. This project aims to address the gap between the service's public APIs/SDKs and direct connections to common applications like Slack, JIRA, and ServiceNow. It enables customers to execute API actions directly from their preferred applications while preserving AWS Security Incident Response core capabilities.

This repository contains:

- **Jira Integration**: Bidirectional integration between AWS Security Incident Response and Jira for issue tracking
- **ServiceNow Integration**: Bidirectional integration between AWS Security Incident Response and ServiceNow for incident management
- **Common Infrastructure**: Shared components like EventBridge event bus, DynamoDB tables, and Lambda layers
- **Deployment Scripts**: Easy-to-use deployment tools for quick setup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** with permissions to create the required resources
- **For Jira integration**
  - Jira Cloud account
- **For ServiceNow integration**
  - ServiceNow instance with admin access

    - `sudo systemctl start docker.service`
    - `docker ps`
    - `chmod a+wr /var/run/docker.sock`
  - Alternatively if you want to use Docker Desktop, follow the guidance in Docker docs for [Getting Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
  
### Setup Solution Repository

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-security-incident-response-integrations.git`
   1. If you had already cloned the repository before, make sure to pull the latest changes: `git pull`
2. Install solution dependencies

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional - for development purposes) Install development dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Deployment

For deployment of an integration pattern, install and use the `deploy-integrations-solution` supplementary python app
in the command-line using the following steps:

1. Add the `deploy-integrations-solution.py` script to the `bin` path using the following commands:

   ```
   sudo cp deploy-integrations-solution.py /usr/local/bin/deploy-integrations-solution
   ```

   ```
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/deploy-integrations-solution
   ```

2. Verify if the `deploy-integrations-solution` works in the command-line by running:

   ```
   deploy-integrations-solution --help
   ```

   You should see the following output:

   ```
   usage: deploy-integrations-solution [-h] [--log-level {info,debug,error}] {jira,service-now} ...

   Deploy AWS Security Incident Response Sample Integrations

   positional arguments:
   {jira,service-now}    Integration type
      jira                Deploy Jira integration
      service-now         Deploy ServiceNow integration

   options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit

3. Alternatively, if you are not able to add the `deploy-integrations-solution.py` script to the `bin` path, you can use the script directly by replacing `deploy-integrations-solution` in the above examples with `./deploy-integrations-solution.py` command.

4. See [JIRA documentation](documentation/JIRA/JIRA.md) for detailed instructions on how to deploy JIRA integration.
5. See [ServiceNow documentation](documentation/SERVICE_NOW/SERVICE_NOW.md) for detailed instructions on how to deploy ServiceNow integration.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Failed Event Delivery

**What happens if updates from AWS Security Incident Response or Jira/ServiceNow fail?**

The integration includes robust error handling mechanisms:

1. **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Events that fail to be delivered to EventBridge are sent to a DLQ
2. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Alarms trigger when messages appear in the DLQ
3. **CloudWatch Dashboard**: Provides visibility into the integration's health

![AWS Security Incident Response CloudWatch Dashboard](documentation/images/cloud-watch-new.png)

**Where is the DLQ?**

The DLQ is a standard Amazon SQS queue that EventBridge uses to store events that couldn't be delivered to a target. Look for an SQS queue with a name similar to `AwsSecurityIncidentResponseSample-SecurityIncidentEventBusLoggerdead-*` and check for messages.

#### Processing Failed Events

To process failed events in the DLQ:

1. Navigate to the SQS console and find the DLQ
2. Select the messages and choose "View/Delete Messages"
3. Examine the message content to understand the failure
4. Manually process the events or use the AWS SDK to programmatically process them

### Integration-Specific Troubleshooting

- For Jira integration issues, see the [Jira Integration Troubleshooting Guide](documentation/JIRA/JIRA.md#troubleshooting)
- For ServiceNow integration issues, see the [ServiceNow Integration Troubleshooting Guide](documentation/SERVICE_NOW/SERVICE_NOW_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
